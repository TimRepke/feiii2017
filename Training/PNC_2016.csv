laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its

the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.","Neutral","Note: This assumes PNC is an affiliate of itself, which is consistent with the text and example training data."
