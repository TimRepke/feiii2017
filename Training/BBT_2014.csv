"10-K","BB&T CORP","92230","2013-FY","2/25/2014","BB&T","","counterparties","Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of
trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BB&T has exposure to many different industries and counterparties,
and BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry,
including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many
of these transactions expose BB&T to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.","Neutral","-1.0.0"
"10-K","BB&T CORP","92230","2013-FY","2/25/2014","BB&T","","counterparties","BB&T mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews
and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required
to provide collateral to BB&T when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair value of interest
rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments
that BB&T does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee.","Relevant","1.1.1"

default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation with
BB&T or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower,
obligor, or counterparty.","Neutral","-1.0.-1"

"10-K","BB&T CORP","92230","2013-FY","2/25/2014","BB&T","","guarantor","While this review
is largely focused on the borrower?s ability to repay the loan, BB&T also considers the capacity and willingness of a
loan?s guarantors to support the debt service on the loan as a secondary source of repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the
documented capacity and willingness to support the loan, BB&T may consider extending the loan maturity and/or temporarily deferring
principal payments if the ultimate collection of both principal and interest is not in question. In these cases, BB&T may not
deem the loan to be impaired due to the documented capacity and willingness of the guarantor to repay the loan.","Relevant","1.1.0"
