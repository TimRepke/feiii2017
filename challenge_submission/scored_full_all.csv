Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from the default, inability, or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or
counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation with BB&T or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty."

If a servicer does not fulfill its servicing obligations (including its repurchase or other responsibilities), we may seek to recover the amounts that such servicer owes us, such as by attempting to sell the applicable mortgage servicing rights to a 42 Freddie Mac Table of Contents different servicer and applying the proceeds to such owed amounts. However, we face the risk that we might not receive a sufficient price for the mortgage servicing rights or that we may be unable to find buyers who are willing to assume the representations and warranties of the former servicer and have sufficient capacity to service the affected mortgages."

Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy
Proceedings On March 18, 2011,
Citigroup and Related Parties were named as defendants in an adversary
proceeding captioned LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. v. CITIBANK, N.A., ET AL. In the complaint, which asserts claims under
federal bankruptcy and state law, the Securities Investor Protection Act Trustee
alleges that a $1 billion cash deposit Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI) placed with
Citibank prior to the commencement of liquidation proceedings should be returned
to the bankruptcy estate, that Citibank?s setoff against the $1 billion deposit
to satisfy its claims against LBI should be set aside, and that approximately
$342 million in additional deposits by LBI currently held by Citibank and its
affiliates should be returned to the estate. Citigroup has moved to dismiss the
adversary complaint."

Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees and third-party sponsors for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, including claims related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. Over time, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from certain private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statute of limitations relating to representations and warranties repurchase claims, and we believe it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims from private-label securitization trustees with standing to bring such claims."

Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees and third-party sponsors for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, including claims related to first-lien third-party sponsored securitizations that include monoline insurance. Over time, there has been an increase in requests for loan files from certain private-label securitization trustees, as well as requests for tolling agreements to toll the applicable statute of limitations relating to representations and warranties repurchase claims and the Corporation believes it is likely that these requests will lead to an increase in repurchase claims for private-label securitization trustees with standing to bring such claims."
